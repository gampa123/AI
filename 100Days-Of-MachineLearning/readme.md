## Support Vector Machine | Day 6


## K-Means | Day 7

Let's say we are given Weight and Height of the of the Chimps and Monkey we have to make two dfferent clusters.The Essentail Idea: 

- Distance between the points within a cluster should be Minimized
- Distance of points belonging to different cluster should be maximized
